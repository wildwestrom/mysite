Find me at [[https://www.westrom.xyz/][https://www.westrom.xyz/]].

I recently rewrote this site in Svelte from ClojureScript.

** Develop
#+begin_src shell
  yarn watch
#+end_src

*** TODO JankLog
- Storybook cannot be built on packages using ~"type": "module"~.
  Currently there's no good workaround; https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/11587
  Wait until [[https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/11587][#345]] gets resolved.
- For some reason CircleCI stopped working.
  #+begin_example
  Warning: No authentication provided, using CircleCI credentials for pulls from Docker Hub.
    image cache not found on this host, downloading cimg/node:latest

  Error response from daemon: manifest for cimg/node:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
  #+end_example
- [[https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg][Uniorg]] also doesn't support ES modules and the creator doesn't intend to anytime soon.
  There might be a workaround by configuring ~vite.ssr~ in ~svelte.config.js~.


*** TODO Figure out a design for this site.

** Release
#+begin_src shell
  yarn release
#+end_src
